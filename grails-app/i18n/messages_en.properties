footer.menu.footerWhatIsKuorum.description1 = Kuorum.org is a social company aimed to improve the communication between citizens and their political representatives through technology. This organization proposes a new way of doing politics in which elected officials involve the citizenry in the decision making processes. Besides it points out the need for transparency in the relations between politicians and lobbying groups.
footer.menu.footerWhatIsKuorum.description2 = In our website parliamentarians and councilors from around the globe open their projects to debate with their electorate. Citizens and organizations can vote those projects and make proposals to improve them. Finally, elected officials support the best proposals. In Kuorum.org accountable commitments turn into victories for the whole community.
footer.menu.footerVision.description1 = Kuorum.org is the leading technology for citizen-politician communication management. Kuorum.org is a social company, which means that our social goals are first. And therefore, beyond technology development tasks, we focus our activity in the organization of events and training sessions to promote a more democratic and participative culture. Our revenue model is based in payment accounts for elected officials, which allows us to be sustainable without advertisement.
footer.menu.footerVision.description2 = Our vision is divided in three areas. Technology: We care for the user experience in our tools in order to promote a constructive and responsible participation. Politics: We enable transparency in the interaction between citizens, organizations and policy makers at local, regional, state and supranational level. Social: We foster participation among the less favored social groups through our offline activity.
footer.menu.footerVision.description3 = HPI<sup>3</sup> is the acronym of our core values: Happiness, People, Innovation, Integrity and Impartiality.
footer.menu.footerProjects.description1 = In Kuorum.org public officials deliberate with their electors about <strong>Political Projects</strong> that will affect the whole community, either at a local, regional, state or supranational level. Only politicians who subscribe a verified account at Kuorum.org are allowed to publish their projects. Then citizens vote and make improvement proposals for a limited time.
footer.menu.footerProjects.description2 = <strong>Citizen Proposals</strong> are always linked to a political project identified by a unique <em>#hashtag</em>. Citizen proposals are the main feature of Kuorum.org. Users can promote those proposals they like the most, so that they are organized hierarchically and automatically. Finally politicians can debate citizen proposals or even support them and commit to make them come true. If they fulfill their promises, the author of the proposal will grant them a victory, the victory of democracy.
footer.menu.footerCitizens.description1 = Kuorum.org is a tool thought by and for citizens. That democracy does not only consist in voting once every four or five years is an already hackneyed quote. But citizens can neither be paying attention at every public affair all the time. Therefore in Kuorum.org you choose the areas that really matter to you. Those where you think you have something to put in: education, agriculture, economy, etc. And we notify it to you when a politician of your region opens a debate on any of those issues.
