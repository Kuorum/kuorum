landingCaseStudy.001.content.title=Toledo city council digitalises participation
landingCaseStudy.001.card.subtitle=How to use technology to strengthen local associations and foster an active and participatory citizenship.
landingCaseStudy.001.content.text.1=The Youth Engagement Department of the city council of Toledo was living a key moment when they approached us. The first half of the term in office was over and councillor Helena Galán had achieved to implement structural reforms through a new regulation on participation. The main change was the creation of assemblies that complemented the work of traditional district councils, allowing for a greater implication of most local associations.
landingCaseStudy.001.content.text.2=Nonetheless, in order for those reforms to have a real impact in the non-organized citizenship participation rates, it was necessary to implement a new action plan. Helena knew that one of the keys was to strengthen local associations. And then new online participation channels could be successfully opened. But, <strong>how should she do that?</strong>
landingCaseStudy.001.content.text.3=First our consultants touched base with Helena's team and with other city councillors. They were really committed to foster transparency and participation in the city government. But the actions carried out so far didn't have a clear goal. One of the major weaknesses of Helena's team was the lack of material and human resources, sometimes compensated by long hours of work that wouldn't necessarily translate into better results.
landingCaseStudy.001.content.text.4=Kuorum worked on a customized offer for the city council of Toledo. Our consultants had then the chance to deepen into the work that was being done in every district. We made a stakeholder analysis and we selected some hot topics that were fit for a fruitful and constructive debate. That work served as a basis to elaborate the first <strong>Action Plan to Invigorate Citizen Engagement</strong> in one of the historical cities of southern Europe.
landingCaseStudy.001.content.text.5=Some of the measures taken in that plan were: Participatory processes' management trainings for elected officials and public servants, online campaigning trainings for local associations, and the implementation of a free participation software for the city council, so that citizens and the administration could debate online.
landingCaseStudy.001.content.text.6=After the success of this pilot project, the city council of Toledo is thinking of opening its first participatory budget, a milestone that seemed unattainable only some months before. Finally, thanks to the great job done in Toledo by Helena and her team with our help, the city was selected to become the location of the 2018 NovaGob Congress, an important international event on public innovation.

landingCaseStudy.002.content.text.1=With the appearance of social networks and the democratization of information, media has suffered a tough identity crisis. Reducing the audience’s passiveness and offering them a different experience is a difficult thing to do. But digital media still have a lot to say in the internet era.
landingCaseStudy.002.content.text.2=Unidad Editorial is one of the most important media groups in Spanish language. Its economic newspaper Expansión is the most read in Spain. And its digital newspaper El Mundo is among the fifteenth most visited sited in the country.
landingCaseStudy.002.content.text.3=During the elections of 2016, after four electoral processes took place in less than two years, it was very complicated for the media to capture the attention of readers of political content. <strong>Kuorum develops digital projects than help companies to increase the engagement and participation of their employees and customers but, what could we offer to the readers of a newspaper?</strong>
landingCaseStudy.002.content.text.4=We decided to give readers the ability to generate data that creates new graphic content. People reading political news could simultaneously rate those presidential candidates  appearing on those pieces of news. Thereby users had a gamified experience. The newspaper was not only informing them, it was asking them for their opinion. Furthermore, readers could see the results of their ratings in real time. And there was historical data as well.
landingCaseStudy.002.content.text.5=We added graphs with the moving average of ratings, so that readers could identify trends and see how specific pieces of news were affecting the perception people had about different politicians. But things didn't stop there. We told readers to visit the digital edition of the newspaper during the presidential debate on TV. <strong>That hybrid experience did not only retain visits to our client's site but also served to generate new information that attracted more readers</strong>. Finally, rating graphs were the basis for new pieces of news.
landingCaseStudy.002.content.text.6=Thanks to this experience, Kuorum has continued developing technolgy for digital media. If you want to know more about our widgets please don''t hesitate to read our information for the <a href=''{0}'' target='_blank'>press</a>.

landingCaseStudy.003.content.title=Oxfam gives visibility to its advocacy campaigns
landingCaseStudy.003.card.subtitle=Ten organizations led by Oxfam let their followers be the ones to advocate for them in front of political parties.
landingCaseStudy.003.content.text.1=Oxfam leads the consortium called Poletika, with other ten organizations and civil society movements. Poletika was born in 2015 as a political advocacy instrument. Its founders wanted to put pressure on political parties for them to include in their manifestos the demands of the consortium.
landingCaseStudy.003.content.text.2=When the elections came, Poletika started a monitoring phase. They checked if those promises made by political parties during the previous months were in fact being included in their manifestos. The task of monitoring all the public statements of so many politicians through different channels and during such a long period was titanic. And so they came out with an original solution\: Letting their affiliates and followers help them. A crowd sourcing strategy, similar to the one used by Wikipedia.
landingCaseStudy.003.content.text.3=This second phase of Poletika was a huge success in terms of participation and impact. The brand appeared several times on national TV and some politicians even replied to their claims in social networks and offline events. But the electoral period came to an end and Poletika had to reinvent itself. It was time to put pressure on elected officials to make sure all those commitments that took so much effort did not come to nothing. <strong>That was the moment when they came to us looking for ideas to launch their new website and digital strategy for this third phase of the project</strong>.
landingCaseStudy.003.content.text.4=First our consultants collected aggregated data about the usage of Poletika's previous website and social networks. Thanks to our data analysts we discovered some weaknesses, like frictions in the user journey, confusing call-to-actions and the absence of a user retention strategy. Only with that information we could have made a solid proposal. But after meeting the founders of Poletika we realized about the great potential and creativity of those people who had led successfully such an ambitious digital project  without the help of online communication experts. And therefore we decided to help them elaborate a proposal by themselves through an inception session.
landingCaseStudy.003.content.text.5=Inception sessions are workshops that normally last for several days. In those workshops we normally gather people with different levels within the organization and guide them through a creative process to identify the weaknesses in their website (or their digital strategy) and generate ideas to solve them. Then we apply selection techniques to discard the great majority of those ideas and stick only to those that really add value in line with our client's strategic goals. Then one of our developers transforms those ideas into the group of development tasks necessary to implement them. She assigns an economic value to each of the tasks - hours of effort or points. And finally we distribute a limited number of points among the attendees and we let them discuss about how to invest them\: Which tasks do they want to get first? <strong>Thereby we get clients to prioritise their web development needs correctly even if they don\'t have the needed technical knowledge</strong>.
landingCaseStudy.003.content.text.6=Oddly enough, some of the conclusions they reached were foreseeable, like the need to reduce frictions in the user journey. But some other, mainly those related to the way they worked among themselves, we could have never imagined. Today Poletika continues gathering citizen support for their political advocacy campaigns and giving them visibility. Now their website and their digital strategy is in line with their goals and with the resources they have.

landingCaseStudy.004.content.title=Kaunas citizens design their cycle lane
landingCaseStudy.004.card.subtitle=The government of this Lithuanian city organises workshops to elaborate its plan to foster the use of bicycles.
landingCaseStudy.004.content.text.1=Kaunas is the second largest city in Lithuania. And historically it has been its financial and cultural capital. Councillor of mobility, Rimantas Mikaitis, is preparing an ambitious plan to multiply by five the number of people using the bicycle to move around the city (currently three thousand people). In order to achieve this goal he plans to create new cycle lanes and park places. Besides, he wants to set up a new bicycle renting system.
landingCaseStudy.004.content.text.2=Nonetheless, experience shows us that it is not enough with good intentions and projects elaborated by experts for this kind of incentives to be successful. A change in transportation habits requires a deep cultural transformation. And therefore Rimantas decided to open a participatory process and collect citizen proposals for his project. But, is there anybody who did something similar in the past?
landingCaseStudy.004.content.text.3=<strong>In Kuorum we work with governments and public administrations in six countries. And that gives us the ability to see the full picture, which brings value to all of our customers</strong>. But mainly to those in local governments, who normally have less chances to live overseas experiences. In this case, the participatory processes that our team experienced in Manchester during the electoral rally of the current major Andy Burnham, served as inspiration for the project we designed in Kaunas.
landingCaseStudy.004.content.text.4=In the Manchester processes, the need for offline sector events was pointed out from the beginning. <strong>Participation wasn't conceived as a mere exchange of online proposals, but as a series of workshops where people could debate face to face and confront opposing visions</strong>. Those events were open to everybody willing to participate, but those interested in specific verticals were the most active ones. Bike lovers in Manchester had the chance to explain which were the main negative incentives to use the bicycle in Manchester at that time. Then they proposed ways to overcome those obstacles. And that is how Manchester adopted one of the most innovative bicycle renting systems in the world, one in which people can pick up and leave bikes wherever they like instead of having to look for fix park places.
landingCaseStudy.004.content.text.5=The participatory process in Kaunas is still open. So it is too soon to know what the result will be. But citizens have already made the project theirs. And that is already a first success for Rimantas.

landingCaseStudy.005.content.title=A community engagement guide to fight depopulation
landingCaseStudy.005.card.subtitle=Experts in constitutional law and comic artists working together to produce a Community Engagement Guide.
landingCaseStudy.005.content.text.1=Kuorum is a platform with powerful tools for governments and corporations to manage online participation. But sometimes it is still too early for our clients to integrate our technology. That was the case of the Regional Government of Zaragoza.
landingCaseStudy.005.content.text.2=With almost one million inhabitants, the region of Zaragoza, in the north of Spain, concentrates a great part of its population in its capital city. So that, in rural areas, seven out of every ten villages is about to disappear.  The problem of depopulation is complex and it requires to act in many ways. One of them is community engagement.
landingCaseStudy.005.content.text.3=Following the example of the H Scottish Highlands, where community engagement was crucial to find solutions to depopulation, the Regional Government of Zaragoza wanted to increase the level o participation of neighbours in their communities. Before hiring us, the government did a thorough analysis of the situation producing twenty five reports with diagnostics for every sub-region.
landingCaseStudy.005.content.text.4=Apart from technology, for years Kuorum has given advice to local governments on how to better engage with their communities. In the case of Zaragoza, after studying all the reports produced by the government, we realized that it was necessary to start from the basics. The population needed to know about the existence of all the resources that the administration was unsuccessfully trying to make available for them. And therefore we decided together with the client to elaborate the Community Engagement Guide.
landingCaseStudy.005.content.text.5=The guide needed to be simple and informational. And it needed to be very visual. So we called a professional comic artist and script writer. At the same time, the content needed to be rigorous, so we took on two academic experts in constitutional law. It was decided to divide the  guide in two parts. One part would include the theory, curiosities and practical exercises. And the other part would be a comic explaining the story of a young citizen of the region who would face a problem that could only be solved with the help of her neighbours. Both parts, however, would be connected through the illustrations. And everything in less than 5,000 words to make sure that it could be read completely in less than 25 minutes.
landingCaseStudy.005.content.text.6=More than 3,000 copies of the guide were distributed among 292 municipalities. And it was also distributed online, the complete guide and small pieces of it through social networks. The Community Engagement Guide of Zaragoza is now a benchmark of quality among borough and city councils, associations and schools around the country. And other local councils have decided to follow the same route. Will that be your case?

landingCaseStudy.006.content.title=Regional government encourages citizen participation
landingCaseStudy.006.card.subtitle=The regional government of Extremadura launches its new Citizen Engagement Service.
landingCaseStudy.006.content.text.1=In 2011, former US President Barack Obama launched the Open Government Partnership program (OGP) - a process designed to make governments more open and communicative with their constituents. In accordance with the OGP, in 2013 the regional government of Extremadura passed a law that would require the region to improve citizen participation, government transparency, and political accountability.
landingCaseStudy.006.content.text.2=However, four years later, in 2017 when Ignacio García Peredo was chosen to serve as Extremadura’s General Secretary of Public Administration, he was disheartened to learn that no progress had been made toward these three goals. With the promise Extremadura had made with the OGP in mind, Ignacio García Peredo decided to take action by implementing an initiative to increase citizen participation. But working on his own without an expert-level understanding of digital participation software, Peredo was unsure of where to begin.
landingCaseStudy.006.content.text.3=That’s where Kuorum comes in. As a tool to help manage and increase participation, Kuorum gives clients the means to create their own websites that include features designed to aid in growth and organization every step of the way. By supporting Peredo through consultancy services, Kuorum helped set up the tool for him with correct security standards and appropriate personal data protection regulations, so that all he had to think about was responding to his citizen’s ideas. In order to jumpstart the process of citizen involvement, Ignacio used Kuorum’s forum feature to easily set up an open online forum where citizens could submit proposals for new programs or ideas that answered the question “How do you want your government to attend to you?”
landingCaseStudy.006.content.text.4=During this process, which lasted for the duration of November 2017, Peredo could directly access and respond to each proposal made by a citizen on the website he had set up through Kuorum. Accordingly, through this method of response, many citizens were given a clear demonstration of the precise lines of open and fast communication that they had requested of the government in their proposals, while Peredo was able to demonstrate his commitment to community involvement and collaboration.
landingCaseStudy.006.content.text.5=Kuorum was further able to help Peredo by preparing the regional government of Extremadura for future projects surrounding digital integration. Through Kuorum’s event feature, Peredo organized and carried out two training sessions for Extremadura’s personnel, thus ensuring that the government will be prepared for similar initiatives in the future.
landingCaseStudy.006.content.text.6=By January, 2018, after receiving more than 70 citizen proposals and more than 4,600 views of the forum, Kuorum categorized and put together the citizens’ recommendations into a comprehensive proposal of citizen actions, 33 of which were chosen by the regional government of Extremadura to look into further. As a final result, Kuorum was able to assist in Ignacio García Peredo’s goals of boosting citizen participation, and beginning to develop more ways to communicate with Extremadura’s citizens as they look to implement the agreed-upon actions in the future. And with the success of this initiative, Peredo gained recognition within both his department, and his community.

landingCaseStudy.007.content.title=Sacyr creates an increase in employee training rates
landingCaseStudy.007.card.subtitle=A thorough study of employee data helped the multinational contractor to enhance employee engagement.
landingCaseStudy.007.content.text.1=In late 2017, the multinational construction company Sacyr was facing a major problem surrounding their employees’ use of Sacyr’s own training software, My Virtual Point (MVP). Though MVP was launched to more than 5,500 employees, less than a 1/3 of those employees were both accessing and finishing the training programs. Confronted with the reality of low employee participation and completion rates, Sacyr lacked the expertise in online employee engagement to improve these rates on their own and were unsure of how to address the problem at such a large scale.
landingCaseStudy.007.content.text.2=Fortunately, with the support of Kuorum, Sacyr would soon be armed with the means to initiate a comprehensive participation increase strategy. Kuorum functions as a tool to help manage and increase participation through easy-to-use features such as forums, proposals, surveys, and event organization. By choosing Kuorum, Sacyr gained capacity to gather data surrounding employee usage of MVP.
landingCaseStudy.007.content.text.3=With the help of Kuorum, Sacyr conducted several different research initiatives that helped them arrive at conclusions surrounding employee demographics, one of which was a survey of employees. The responses to this survey helped demonstrate to Sacyr which specific demographics within the company were using MVP the least.
landingCaseStudy.007.content.text.4=However, not only did Kuorum help Sacyr see which groups of employees were not using MVP, but it also aided in Sacyr’s desire to understand why participation rates among these groups were low and, accordingly, how they could be improved. Since Kuorum allows each client to customize the content of their features to best fit their needs, its customers have the ability to ask employees specifically about the aspects they care about. For Sacyr, this culminated in quantifiable results that suggested which specific groups needed to targeted in order to greatly increase participation within the company.
landingCaseStudy.007.content.text.5=In the end, Kuorum not only helped Sacyr learn how to boost participation with MVP, but also how to increase employee participation during future projects. Kuorum is able to provide consistency through the functionality of it’s features, but also diversity through the applicability of those features, meaning that no matter what sort of participation a client is seeking to manage and increase, Kuorum can give them the tools to successfully carry out their initiative.

landingCaseStudy.008.content.title=A participatory budget for the youth
landingCaseStudy.008.card.subtitle=The city council put in place an innovative initiative to let the city’s youth decide in which leisure time projects to invest.
landingCaseStudy.008.content.text.1=In January 2018, the local government of Toledo came to Kuorum in light of new recently introduced citizen participation expectations set by the Department of Participation and Transparency. Led by Toledo councilwoman Helen Galán, the Department of Participation and Transparency had just completed a successful organization of the city’s first district assemblies in December 2017. As part of this organization, Galán wanted to implement new programs that would increase Toledo citizen participation both in person and online. However, without specific experience in the field of digital participation software, Galán decided to bring in outside help in order to find the best possible way to increase Toledo’s participation. 
landingCaseStudy.008.content.text.2=With Kuorum’s expertise, Galán and the Department of Participation and Transparency developed a multi-phase plan to first measure, then increase citizen participation in Toledo. Working toward the goal of integrated citizen collaboration on government spending and projects, Kuorum helped the department begin to focus specifically on increasing the engagement of Toledo’s youth - a vital part of the city’s communities - through a participatory budget campaign.
landingCaseStudy.008.content.text.3=For each client, Kuorum works as a tool to help manage and increase participation through a series of easy-to-use digital features. In the case of Toledo, Kuorum was able to provide Galán with the participation software she needed to both reach out to Toledo’s youth, and to receive feedback from them about some of Toledo’s programs. Since the younger generation will eventually become more politically active in the community with time, establishing strong participation rates now will undoubtedly serve the local government of Toledo well in the future.
landingCaseStudy.008.content.text.4=<b>Supported by Kuorum, the Department of Participation and Transparency worked to develop a comprehensive digital strategy to engage the city’s youth in online participation.</b> Kuorum hosts several contact management features that help clients systematically organize their contacts while working toward higher levels of activity and participation. For Toledo, these features culminated in the gathering of youth contacts through responses to this initiative that will be used to build up a base of informed and involved citizens participating in the government’s programs. 
landingCaseStudy.008.content.text.5=By using Kuorum to help increase youth participation and engagement, Helen Galán has demonstrated herself to be councilwoman with a strong commitment to citizen involvement in Toledo’s legislation. Kuorum’s features and team take care of the technical side of things, leaving each client free to focus on the concerns and proposals of their citizens or employees. With Kuorum’s help, Galán and the Department of Participation and Transparency of Toledo were able to successfully gather feedback from the city’s youth about programs they would like to initiate, and can now focus on taking steps to implement those programs soon.

landingCaseStudy.009.content.title=Manchester co-creates regulation to end homelessness 
landingCaseStudy.009.card.subtitle=Mayor of Greater Manchester leads a collaborative rule making effort to reduce rough sleeping in the next three years. 
landingCaseStudy.009.content.text.1=In May 2017, Andy Burnham was elected to serve as the Mayor of Greater Manchester. Not wasting any time, in August 2017 Burnham launched the End Rough Sleeping by 2020 Plan - a campaign designed to engage the entire community of Greater Manchester in the search for solutions to end homelessness. However, due to the fact that Greater Manchester boasts a population of almost 3 million inhabitants, asking the citizens to work together as one posed a great challenge for Burnham. In order to coordinate ideas and proposals across such a large group of people, Burnham knew that using online communication methods would be the best way to collaborate. But with countless online participation services available today, Burnham was unsure of which platform would be best.  
landingCaseStudy.009.content.text.2=With the help of Kuorum, Andy Burnham and the Greater Manchester Mayor’s Office began to create a comprehensive strategy that would incentivize citizens to participate in the plan’s development. As a tool designed to help manage and increase participation, Kuorum gives clients access to easy-to-use features aimed at facilitating citizen engagement and collaboration. Surpassing the operations of just a website, Kuorum is software that functions as a service, providing important updates and new developments as client's projects grow.
landingCaseStudy.009.content.text.3=For Greater Manchester, this resulted in the implementation of participation initiatives in multiple different sectors. As part of Burnham’s approach, Kuorum helped coordinate training sessions for some of the county’s existing homeless organizations on how to successfully use Kuorum to engage the public. Furthermore, Kuorum’s contact management features such as email blasts and measures of user activity level can help ensure that the Greater Manchester Mayor’s Office will have a strong base of citizens to communicate with about Burnham’s initiative. 
landingCaseStudy.009.content.text.4=By not only taking action to end homelessness, but also taking clear steps to involve the public of Greater Manchester in the decision making process, Mayor Andy Burnham established himself as a strong proponent of citizen participation and dynamic community-building programs. Since Kuorum helps each client bring attention to the issues they care about, every customer can use Kuorum’s tools to create a reputation for themselves within their own community, company, or organization. Just three months into 2018, Burnham has already been able to raise nearly 100,000 pounds for his End Rough Sleeping by 2020 Plan, and will be remembered in Greater Manchester for his initiatives in the future.

footerBlog.002.content.title=How to choose tools for community engagement
footerBlog.002.card.subtitle=Choosing the right community engagement platform for your administration is easy if you know what to look for.
footerBlog.002.content.text.1=In the past few years, promoting citizen participation has become an important strategy for many governments. Municipalities and regional administrations are starting to create designated departments and councillor positions that are dedicated to managing citizen participation. The most advanced ones are even launching participation websites in which residents can get involved in local political development.
footerBlog.002.content.text.2=Today, there are multiple technology providers offering tools that deal with citizen participation. If you are an elected official or a public employee and you work in the community engagement sector, it is possible that you have already been approached by more than one of these companies offering their services.<b>But how do you distinguish the grain from the straw? What solutions are best suited to your needs? And, just as importantly, how much should you be willing to spend?</b>
footerBlog.002.content.text.3=<a href="https://kuorum.org" target="_blank">Kuorum</a> has years of citizen engagement advising experience with local and regional governments in six countries. In most cases, the greatest administrative challenge is not technological, but is rather strategic. Some invest in a technology before creating a participation census, analyzing the associated network within the municipality, or adequately researching the modernity of the participation rules. This will make the results suffer. And because of this, our consultants offer a free first meeting that addresses key issues such as these. 
footerBlog.002.content.text.4=Once the strategic part has been resolved, it is time to choose which technology best suits you. The first thing to consider is how the platform is going to help you organize your contacts. Is it going to let you segment the participation census? Will it help you identify users based on activity level? Will you be able to use it to send mass emails? All of these features are essential to raising rates of participation.
footerBlog.002.content.text.5=Furthermore, a participation strategy will be very different in a large city with millions of people than it will be in a small rural town. Participatory budgets, for example, can make sense in the first case, especially if there is already a strong culture of participation in place. However, in the instance of a small town, organizing digital or in-person assemblies may be more convenient for most citizens. For this reason, <b>you must ask yourself what kinds of processes will allow you to open your platform and how well they will fit your specific case.</b>
footerBlog.002.content.text.6=You have to keep in mind that web service development is a highly complicated task that requires the work of many qualified professionals: engineers, designers, and, crucial to the platform’s success, experts in charge of optimizing user experience. If you try to use a participation platform and begin to feel lost or don’t know where to click, then your provider has not invested enough in the tool’s design. This will cause your participation rates to plummet.
footerBlog.002.content.text.7=Lastly, remember that you can choose between the implementation of a web on a server (either on your property or in the cloud), or the use of a software as a service (SaaS). The second option has the appeal of a more advantageous price because it includes free updates that will be made to the software as time goes on. And don’t forget, the participation platform should not serve as an end in itself, but rather as a tool. Your constituents are of the highest importance. And if they adopt your technology, everything will go smoothly.

footerBlog.003.content.title=How to run a participatory budget
footerBlog.003.card.subtitle=Get to know the distinct methodologies that exist and choose the one that is best suited to the reality of your municipality.
footerBlog.003.content.text.1=A participatory budget is a method of citizen participation in which neighbors are involved in allocation decisions of various economic resources to different city improvement projects. Participatory budgets are complex processes that require great technical and communication efforts. This is why it is not advisable to implement participatory budgets in municipalities where there is not a strong culture of participation or where the city council does not have qualified public employees. 
footerBlog.003.content.text.2=If you are a city councillor or participation technician and you’re not sure if it would be wise to try out a participatory budget in your city, you can start by answering these questions: <b>Do you have a participation census with a sufficient number of emails? Has any online citizen participation project been developed in your city before? Are there a healthy and active associations in town?</b> If any of your answers are “no,” then unfortunately, it’s likely not the right time to implement a participatory budget. But, if on the contrary, you responded affirmatively to all the questions, there are some details you should be sure to understand. 
footerBlog.003.content.text.3=The first thing you should do is reserve a part of the city budget for this purpose. If this is the first time you do this, try to make sure that the quantity does not exceed 2% of the total budget. And remember to reserve at least 0.5% of it for the broadcasting campaign.
footerBlog.003.content.text.4=There are several different methodologies for carrying out participatory budgets. The most common process is to ask citizens to create proposals and then to seek support for them. Next, the proposals go through a technical evaluation in which those that do not meet the process’ criteria are discarded, and the economic value of those remaining is assessed.  In the end, the proposals go to a final vote. This methodology and its variants require a great deal of effort on behalf of the city council’s technicians in evaluating the proposals, so it is important to properly scale your resources and to give your public employees advance notice of the project in order for it to succeed at the highest level possible.  
footerBlog.003.content.text.5=An alternative to this model is to accept only qualified proposals from entities that wish to carry them out - companies, associations, non-profits, etc. These same entities that design the proposals will also budget their projects, meaning that the evaluation process will be less intensive for municipalities. And as it is in the interest of the creators of the projects to end up being selected, they will in turn help create a wider diffusion of the process within the municipality. As a result, citizens will only participate in the final vote and will therefore not be active proponents of change they want to see in their city. 
footerBlog.003.content.text.6=Finally, for less experienced municipalities, there is the option of converting a participatory budget into a simple consultation. The city council can give various options of  where to invest money - in general areas or in concrete projects - and the citizens can select one or more of these choices. This option is the least flexible, but nonetheless carries the advantage of being very easy to explain and to disseminate. 
footerBlog.003.content.text.7=All methodologies have their pros and cons. Choose the one that best suits the reality of your municipality and the resources at your disposal. Once you have chosen the methodology, you will be able to <a href="https://kuorum.org/en/blog/how-to-choose-tools-for-community-engagement" target="_blank">decide which technology</a> you want to use online and can start planning the digital process. Don’t forget to make a calendar and assign your team to various tasks.

footerBlog.004.content.text.1=If you work in the Department of Innovation or Human Resources at a large company, chances are you’ve heard about innovation challenges - and may have even carried some out, with greater or lesser success. But what are they and why is their use spreading so fast?
footerBlog.004.content.text.2=Innovation challenges are a practice derived from Challenge-Based Learning (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge-based_learning" target="_blank">CBL</a>) that emerged from the <i>“Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow-Today”</i>, a project launched by Apple in 2008 to solve real problems in a collaborative, experimental, and progressive way. <b>The use of challenges in learning creates a sense of urgency, passion and ownership among teams, factors that are often missing in the day-to-day functioning of  companies.</b> 
footerBlog.004.content.text.3=There is also a physiological reason behind the challenges’ success in terms of the quality of innovation that these groups produce. The human brain is the organ that consumes the most energy throughout the body, and has therefore evolved to create energy-saving measures throughout time. These measures are called behavior patterns - neural connections that allow us to solve simple problems quickly, but that leave us unable to solve more complex problems by ourselves. This is why humans, like many other mammals, are gregarious animals. Through teamwork, we awaken our creativity if we are in a favourable environment known as the innovation ecosystem.
footerBlog.004.content.text.4=The first key to launching a successful innovation challenge is found precisely in the design of an efficient innovation ecosystem. It is important to think in terms of incentives and resources. <b>What motivation will your employees, students, or other external actors have to participate? Will they have enough time and resources to work? Will the teams have all the knowledge and skills necessary to solve the challenge?</b>   
footerBlog.004.content.text.5=The second key is the dynamization of the challenge. It will be necessary to have a person with experience in this field. It can be someone from your department, or someone from an outside consultancy firm. Their mission should be to correctly <a href="https://bizfluent.com/how-6622699-create-innovation-challenge-statement.html/" target="_blank">define the challenge</a> along with the steering team - the company department that is looking for an innovative solution - and to be in charge of shaping and guiding the teams throughout the process. 
footerBlog.004.content.text.6=If you intend to involve a large part of the company in these challenges, then your choice of digital platform will also be a key determinant of your project’s success. At <a href="https://kuorum.org/en" target="_blank">Kuorum</a>, we have been advising companies and developing technology for this type of activity for years. If you are looking for a platform, make sure it provides a powerful contact manager that facilitates the project’s dynamization, mass emailing features that allow you to schedule your participation campaigns in advance, and several gamified participation alternatives (debates, surveys, events, etc.). 
footerBlog.004.content.text.7=Last but not least, don’t forget to manage the expectations of the participants as well. Once the process has been completed, it is necessary to involve the winning teams in the development of their projects, provide them with sufficient autonomy, and give them proper follow-ups. If the participants believe that their work was all done in vain, they will be very unlikely to participate in such a process again.

footerBlog.005.content.title=What does user-centric design mean?
footerBlog.005.card.subtitle=Involve the client as soon as possible in your innovation process and improve the success rate of your new products.
footerBlog.005.content.text.1=<i>Modern Times</i> is an essential movie for those who work in innovation sectors or in human resources. In the movie, Charlie Chaplin plays a metallurgical worker during the Great Depression. The film serves as a critique of the working conditions of chain production of the time. But, it also displays an example of the large number of errors in the management of innovation that were common in the early twentieth century, and that unfortunately remain a hundred years later.
footerBlog.005.content.text.2=One of the film’s most famous scenes is that of the eating machine. The plant’s innovation team takes advantage of their lunch break to test out a new system designed to feed an employee as he continues to work. The main character is obliged to lend himself as the invention’s guinea pig and, as one would expect, the experiment ends in disaster. The management team therefore disapproves of the invention, and the Director of Innovation is left scratching his chin. What could’ve been done differently?
footerBlog.005.content.text.3=Putting the social critique aside, the most serious error of the innovation manager in this scene was to design and implement a complete product without having involved the user from the start. <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design" target="_blank">User-centric design</a> is a discipline that provides us with tools to design products and services that users adore</b>  - all while shortening the time to market. Detecting the need, going through the prototype, building a proof of concept and a minimum viable product, the customer is at the center of all decisions.
footerBlog.005.content.text.4=Among the tools that exist to collect user feedback are surveys, structured interviews, and empathy maps. It’s not just about asking the customer what he wants - because sometimes not even the customer himself knows - but rather understanding the customer’s problems in detail and finding out what motivates them to act in a certain way in these situations.
footerBlog.005.content.text.5=Once you know your user well enough, you can build a kind of psychological profile of the client called a <a href="https://www.usermuse.com/blog/product-user-persona-disorder/?ref=quuu&utm_content=bufferec4db&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer" target="_blank">Persona</a>. You will have to build a Persona for each customer segment, and for each Persona you will have to generate a <a href="https://conversionxl.com/blog/customer-journey-mapping-examples/" target="_blank">user journey</a>. Starting the design of products and services with a user journeys is a highly recommended practice, as it helps us to awaken our creativity without completely taking our feet off the ground.
footerBlog.005.content.text.6=Finally, you will have to test the solution that results from the user journey with a real client. But if you wait until you have a finished product to test these results, it will be too expensive and too risky. Rather than waiting, you can test a prototype, a simulation, or even use a simple questionnaire. Tools like <a href="https://kuorum.org/en" target="_blank">Kuorum</a> help large corporations receive feedback from potential customers while rewarding them for their loyalty, thus offering you the pure style of <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/" target="_blank">ProductHunt</a>, but with your own brand’s look and feel.
